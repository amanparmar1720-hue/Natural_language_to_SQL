# 🧠 Natural Language to SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project converts plain English questions into SQL queries automatically.

Instead of writing SQL manually, a user can type a question like:

> "Show me all customers from India who placed more than 5 orders"

And the system will generate the correct SQL query for it.

This makes data access easier for non-technical users, analysts, and beginners who are not comfortable writing SQL.
