# 🧠 Natural Language to SQL

##  Project Overview
This project converts plain English questions into SQL queries automatically.

Instead of writing SQL manually, a user can type a question like:

> "Show me all customers from India who placed more than 5 orders"

And the system will generate the correct SQL query for it.

This makes data access easier for non-technical users, analysts, and beginners who are not comfortable writing SQL.

##  How It Works (Simple Explanation)
1. The user enters a question in English
2. The system:
   - Understands the intent of the question
   - Identifies tables, columns, and conditions
   - Generates a valid SQL query based on the database schema
3. The SQL query can then be executed on the database
